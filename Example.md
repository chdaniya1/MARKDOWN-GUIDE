```markdown
# Hello Markdown

This is **bold**, *italic*, and a [link](URL_1).

- Item 1
- Item 2
```

In this example:
- The `#` symbol is used to denote a heading, making "Hello Markdown" a prominent title.
- The use of double asterisks `**` before and after text formats it as **bold**, while single asterisks `*` achieve *italic* formatting.
- The `[link](URL_1)` structure creates a hyperlink, where `URL_1` can be replaced with any valid web address, allowing readers to navigate to additional resources or related content.
- Finally, the hyphen `-` denotes a list item, making it easy to create bullet points, as shown with "Item 1" and "Item 2."
